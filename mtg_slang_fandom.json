Removing a Reality Smasher, for example, forces a 2-for-1, since the opponent must discard an additional card to cast a removal spell that targets it. 1-for-2 is less used than \"2-for-1-ing myself\", such as if with Force of Will, and usually the opponent is given credit for achieving a 2-for-1."

However, in various situations, a player may leave some amount of mana in their mana pool. Before the rule changes, this caused players to undergo mana burn upon losing unspent mana. The most common situation in which this occurs is when a player is using a recurring loop of spells or abilities to produce an arbitrarily large amount of mana. Each iteration of the loop produces extra mana, which is left floating until the player has acquired enough excess mana to achieve their desired end. A play might also do this in cases where they will cast a spell to destroy all lands by making sure they have tapped all the mana from their lands first before casting it. The rules require a player who has mana in their mana pool after spending some, or when passing priority, to announce what mana is left. This is usually accomplished with a set of dice or a notepad."
